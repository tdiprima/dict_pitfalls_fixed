## Set Arithmetic Flex

So this code's showing off a **clean little power move** with Python sets 🧠✨

```py
required = set("ABX")
d1 = {"A": 1, "B": 2, "C":3}
d2 = {**d1, "X": 4}
print("d1", d1.keys() >= required)
print("d2", d2.keys() >= required)
```

You've got a list of **required keys**, and you wanna check if your dict's got all of 'em. Normally, people might do something like:

```python
all(k in d1 for k in required)
```

which works fine but looks kinda basic.

Instead, this trick uses **set arithmetic** — since `dict.keys()` behaves like a set, you can just do:

```python
d1.keys() >= required
```

That's basically saying "does my dict's key set contain all of these required ones?" — short, aesthetic, and efficient 🔥

So when you run it:

```python
print("d1 has all required:", d1.keys() >= required)  # False
print("d2 has all required:", d2.keys() >= required)  # True
```

👉 `d1` is missing `"X"`, so it flunks  
👉 `d2` passes the vibe check ✅

TL;DR:  
✅ Use `d.keys() >= required` → efficient + elegant  
❌ Loop over keys manually → it works, but kinda mid
